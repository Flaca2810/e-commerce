          <br />
          In 1913,young Chicago chemist Thomas Williams had a dilemma. His older
          sister, Maybel, was in love with a man who was in love with someone
          else. Maybel Williams did her best with what was availableâ€”she used
          petroleum jelly on her lashes and brows to enhance them. Her brother
          decided to help her increase her allure by adding carbon dust to the
          petroleum jelly, which darkened her lashes and brows more
          dramatically. The product worked. In 1915, Maybel got her man and
          Thomas founded what would become the global industry giant,
          Maybelline, named after the bride and her favourite beauty aid.
          <br />
          <br />
          Two years later, Williams introduced Maybelline Cake Mascara, the
          first modern eye cosmetic made for everyday use. Initially available
          only through mail order, it was so popular that women began to ask for
          it in drugstores. The signature red Eyebrow Pencil followed, along
          with coloured eyeshadows and complementary eyeliners, leading the
          youthful, flapper fashion trend of dramatic makeup. Maybelline became
          the first cosmetic company to advertise on radio and sales boomed. In
          1932, responding to incessant demand, Maybelline introduced a special
          10-cent package of Cake Mascara for retail sale. And the rest, as they
          say, is history!
